# Advanced-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This is an enhanced Python script for sentiment analysis that runs in the VS Code terminal. It builds on basic sentiment classification by adding advanced preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization), robust analysis with NLTK's VADER, subjectivity detection, and innovative batch file processing for multiple texts.
